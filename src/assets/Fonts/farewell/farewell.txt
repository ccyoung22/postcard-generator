My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

A license.txt file should have been included with this font, explaining the
license under which it is made available. You can also read it at:

About the font:

I started out thinking I'd make this font look like my handwriting
but after all the careful work making the letters connect I realized
that this is way too neat to look anything like my handwriting.  I
included some ligatures where I found they helped the look of the 
writing:

   _ => ll
    * => oo
    ^ => tt
    & => of
    # => rr

The spacing of the capitals is a little weird so using all caps
comes out funny.  If you really need all caps I can put in some
kerning pairs to clean it up.
